DISCLAIMER:
===========
This is a simplified system inspired by SAMP's filterscript logic.
Its goal is to streamline how .json mods and parameters can be used to trigger in-game Unity actions.
The system includes basic demo actions (like PrintMessage, TeleportPlayer) ‚Äî but YOU are responsible for writing your own APIs for production usage.

# LoopModding

LoopModding is a lightweight JSON-based modding framework for Unity that enables you to trigger game events and actions via easily editable `.json` files.

This system is designed for:
- Designers to easily define logic outside the Unity Editor
- Developers to expose game functionality in a modular and extensible way
- Servers or solo games that want runtime reactivity without recompiling

- üóÉÔ∏è Load global parameters (like positions, names, etc.) from external `.json`
- üì¶ Hot-reload mods and parameters at runtime

You can register your own game logic and actions using `ModAPI.Register(...)`.
The system handles loading, hot-reloading, and triggering based on events and `.json` structures.
